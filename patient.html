  <h2>🗣️ Real Patient Responses</h2>

  <p><strong>Q: What are your biggest worries about your pacemaker?</strong><br>
  <em>“If it fails while I’m alone, I might not have time to call anyone.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Q: How do you feel between doctor visits?</strong><br>
  <em>“I just hope nothing’s wrong. I feel blind to what’s going on inside.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Q: What would help you feel safer?</strong><br>
  <em>“A system that checks my pacemaker automatically and alerts someone if it fails.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Q: Would you want access to a digital twin system?</strong><br>
  <em>“Yes, if it keeps me and my doctor informed in real-time.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Q: How long have you had your pacemaker implanted?</strong><br>
  <em>“It has been 19 years roughly.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Q: How often do you go for routine check-ups?</strong><br>
  <em>“It used to be every 3 months, now it's 1 time a year when I go back on summer vacation in Qatar.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Q: Have you ever experienced any issues related to the pacemaker?</strong><br>
  <em>“Used to, but there is none now except the inability to sleep on it because you can feel it. My pacemaker changed to a newer model about 5 years ago — the old one lasted almost 6 years, but this one is 10 years and great performance so far.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Q: Has your doctor explained what to do in case of a problem or emergency?</strong><br>
  <em>“I used to be instructed against jumping and other things that could exhaust me — that was in the very first version. Now, I just get told the same as every heart patient: stay healthy, eat well, sleep well, and don’t overwork yourself.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Q: Do you trust the current monitoring system to alert your doctor if something goes wrong?</strong><br>
  <em>“Yes, my doctor has been perfect and attentive for all of the last 15 years.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Q: Would you feel more at ease if there was a system that could monitor your pacemaker in real time and notify your doctor instantly in case of a failure?</strong><br>
  <em>“That would be a bonus. It would be amazing instead of being on the edge.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Q: Are the doctors able to monitor the pacemaker without you visiting?</strong><br>
  <em>“No, just through me visiting from time to time they can be updated.”</em></p>

  <h2>🔍 Summary</h2>
  <p>Patient feedback supports the need for proactive, remote monitoring. Many patients live with silent anxiety about their device’s status and feel disconnected from their own health data. Digital Twin systems not only improve safety but also empower patients with greater confidence and control.</p>
